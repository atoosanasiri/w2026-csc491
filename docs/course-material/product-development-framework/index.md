Product Development Framework: Sprint Architecture & Validation Gates
{: .lecture-title }

CSC491 - Capstone Project Design

{: .lecture-info }
> ### Framework Overview
>
> **Objective:** Define sprint architecture and validation gates that ensure students build products with evidence-based decisions, incremental architectural maturity, and continuous user journey refinement.
>
> **Expert Sources:** Teresa Torres (Continuous Discovery), Chris Richardson (Microservices Patterns), Eric Ries (Lean Startup)
>
> **Core Question:** How do you structure a 10-week sprint cycle so each demo adds one architectural dimension while validating one risky assumption?

This framework is organized into the following sections:

1. [Reasoning & Approach](reasoning-and-approach) - Expert selection rationale, framework prioritization, and targeted design questions.

2. [Expert Frameworks](expert-frameworks) - Continuous Discovery (Torres), Microservices Patterns (Richardson), and Validated Learning (Ries).

3. [Actionable Recommendations](actionable-recommendations) - Validation gates, architectural deep-dive rotation, and CUJ evolution tracking.

4. [Assumptions & Failure Modes](assumptions-and-failure-modes) - Where this framework breaks, scope creep risks, and when to reject this approach.

5. [Sources & Bibliography](sources) - Essential texts and references for product development methodology.
